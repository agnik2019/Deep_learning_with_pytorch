In this repository, I have put my pytorch & pytorch lightning implementation of different deep learning problems.
- All resnet implementation in pytorch (`PA1_DeepLearning_21CS60A01.ipynb`)

- Vision Transformer model & Shifted Patch token.
(`21CS60A01_PA2.ipynb`)

- CNN basic implementations and fine tuning hyperparameters. (Folder: `cnn_21CS60A01_agnik`)

- Using pretrained RNN (True and False) (Folder: `resnet_21CS60A01_agnik`)
